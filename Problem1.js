/**
 * PROBLEM 1: TRACK THE DAYS SINCE HELL ON EARTH
 * If you somehow missed the memo... 2020 was a terrible mistake for everyone involved.
 * So, let's celebrate every day further from this hell!
 *
 * 1. Make a state variable to keep track of the days since 2020. Let's initialize this to 1.
 * 2. Create a function that gets called when you click the <button>
 * Note: if you aren't sure how to handle button clicks, this guide is pretty helpful: https://upmostly.com/tutorials/react-onclick-event-handling-with-examples
 * 3. onClick, you should increment your days by one
 * 4. In the curly braces within the <p> tag {}, display your current "days since 2020"
